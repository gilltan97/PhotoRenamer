# PhotoRenamer
This is a Photo Renaming application created for a class project in CSC207 Fall 2016, which allows the user to easily rename image files on their computer based on a set of tags. The User can view all the image files anywhere under a directory and when viewing an image, the user can select tags from the currently existing tags, add new tags, and delete existing ones from the currently existing ones. The application renames the image file to include the tags, each prefixed with the "@" character. 

The application keeps a log of all the renaming ever done for the user to view. 

Developed in Eclipse.
